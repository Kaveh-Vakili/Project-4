# Project-4

### Project Description:
In this project we are building a Quiz Application where this application will present questions to users and expect the right answers to those questions. It will also store the quizzes and allow users to play the quiz if they want. Our quiz application is similar to programs like Kahoot, where they test users on questions, and present the number of questions they got correct. We believe that our application will most liklely benefit students who are trying to study or anyone trying to retain information. Our code will test the memory and knowledge of the user.

#### Available Quizzes
- UMD Trivia
- Maryland History 
- Make your own quiz **(Allows users to make their own questions and provide their own answers so they can design their own quiz!)**

#### Methodology:
Through this project, our program can read files with questions and present them to the user. And within that, using conditional statements, this will determine whether the user input is correct or incorrect with the given question. Through the usage of loops, this presents an opportunity for the user to retake a quiz if they wish.
#### "Make you're own quiz" 
This option allows the user to make their own questions and answers and then stores it into a text file. This file can be printed out so the user can quiz themselves or friends without the use of a computer. Using the physical copy of the quiz will make studying for quizzes and tests more realistic

How to use
----------
The user will have to select if they want to take one of the pre-made quizzes (FinalGoQuiz.ipynb) or if they want to make their own quiz (Project 4- User builds quiz.ipynb).

1. **Prewritten Quizzes (GoQuiz)** will prompt the user to choose a quiz to take. Then the user will be given questions one by one.
2. The user will have to answer the question choosing between multiple choices using the keys A,B,C,D.
3. The score to their quiz and how many they got wrong will be shown at the end of the quiz.

-------
1. **User Builds Quiz** will prompt the user to make a question and its answer one by one.
2. The program will put the questions and answers in a text file. 
3. It is then up to the user to either print out the quiz physically or put in on a word editor to take.
