# Project-4
In this project we are building a Quiz Application where this application will present questions to users and expect the right answers to those questions. It will also store the quizzes and allow users to play the quiz if they want. Through this project, our program can read files with questions and present them to the user. And within that, using conditional statements, this will determine whether the user input is correct or incorrect with the given question. Through the usage of loops, this presents an opportunity for the user to retake a quiz if they wish. Our quiz application is similar to programs like Kahoot, where they test users on questions, and present the number of questions they got correct. We believe that our application will most liklely benefit students who are trying to study or anyone trying to retain information. Our code will test the memory and knowledge of the user.
